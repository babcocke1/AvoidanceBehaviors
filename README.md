# AvoidanceBehaviors

implements collision and obstacle avoidance based on code from in book and code from in class. The blue objects are avoiding a collision. I steered them by taking the collision location minus the most threatening colliders position. The pink object is seeking the navy object and avoids the wall. I added two whiskers 30 degrees in either direction of the character's velocity.
